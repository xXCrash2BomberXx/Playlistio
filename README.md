# 🔀 Playlistio: Stremio Catalog to Series Playlist Addon

A **Stremio addon** that lets you convert any catalog into a series that works with auto-play.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Convert a Catalog to a Playlist** – Watch entire `catalogs` in order with auto-play by converting them into a Stremio `series` entry.
- **Playlist Grouping** – Put each unique `series` into a different group for easy navigation between the many you generate.
- **Removable Data After** – If you, for some reason, don't want the addons that you "playlistify" still in Stremio after you configure them within this addon, you can simply unisntall them.
- **Additional Quirk** – Although not intentional, by using a catalog of series' in Playlistio and running that into somethng that randomizes the `stream` order, you can essential auto-play a random episode from every season which is a unique way to quickly enjoy the growth of a show over it's seasons. This behavior is likely to change (or become togglable) should Stremio ever add a way to return a `meta` as a response to a `stream` request to allow recursive behavior.

For example, turn this:

Into this (+ support for auo-play):
